BrieflyAI: Intelligent Document Router & SummarizerBrieflyAI is an enterprise-grade document intelligence system designed to automate the intake and processing of high-volume technical documentation. It utilizes a hybrid AI architecture, combining classical machine learning for high-speed routing with deep learning transformers for context-aware summarization.Project OverviewLarge organizations often face bottlenecks in manual document triage. BrieflyAI solves this by instantly classifying incoming text into the correct department and generating a concise executive summary, reducing the time required for human review.Key FeaturesHybrid Architecture: Leverages the speed of Multinomial Naive Bayes for classification and the semantic understanding of the T5 Transformer for summarization.Production MLOps: Includes a dedicated training pipeline that handles model versioning, metadata tracking, and configuration management to ensure reproducibility.Strict Generalization: The training pipeline implements rigorous data cleaning to strip metadata headers, forcing the model to learn from the actual content rather than overfitting on artifacts.CPU Optimized: Designed to run efficiently on standard hardware without requiring GPU acceleration.ArchitectureThe system is built on a decoupled architecture separating the training pipeline from the inference application.Ingestion: Raw text is input via the Streamlit interface.Routing Engine (ML): A TF-IDF vectorizer and Naive Bayes classifier determine the document's category (Medical, IT, Legal, or Logistics).Summarization Engine (DL): A pre-trained T5-Small transformer processes the text to generate an abstractive summary.MLOps Layer: Manages model artifacts and metadata JSONs to ensure the application always loads the correct production model version.InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/monikaasidhu/BrieflyAI.git](https://github.com/monikasidhu/BrieflyAI.git)

Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Setup:This project requires the "20 Newsgroups" dataset (By Date version).Download the dataset archive.Extract the category folders (sci.med, comp.graphics, talk.politics.misc, rec.autos) into a local directory named data_cache.Usage1. Train the ModelRun the training pipeline to process the data and generate the model artifacts. This script reads the flat text files, cleans headers to prevent data leakage, and saves the versioned model to the models/ directory.python train_pipeline.py
2. Run the ApplicationLaunch the web interface. The application will automatically detect and load the latest trained model configuration.python -m streamlit run app.py
ValidationTo ensure the model learns semantic context rather than memorizing keywords, it was validated against inputs devoid of domain-specific jargon.Test Case:Input: "I have a throbbing pain in my temples and I feel nauseous whenever I see bright light."Prediction: Medical TriageResult: Pass (Correctly inferred context without explicit keywords like "doctor" or "hospital").LicenseMIT License
